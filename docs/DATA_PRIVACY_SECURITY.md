## Executive Overview

MedExtract is designed with healthcare data privacy and security as foundational principles. This document outlines the security measures, compliance considerations, and operational procedures necessary to maintain data privacy in healthcare environments.

### Key Security Features
- **Local Processing**: All data remains within institutional boundaries
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Fully functional in air-gapped environments
- **Encrypted Storage**: Options for data-at-rest encryption
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access configuration

### Compliance Scope
- Designed for HIPAA-regulated environments
- Supports GDPR requirements for EU institutions
- Aligns with state privacy regulations (CCPA, etc.)
- Facilitates institutional security policies

## Data Privacy Architecture

### Data Flow Overview

```
[Clinical System] → [Export] → [Local Storage] → [MedExtract Processing] → [Results Storage]
                                       ↓                    ↓
                                 [Encrypted]          [No External Transmission]
```

### Privacy by Design Principles

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Process only required data elements
   - Automatic removal of temporary files
   - Configurable retention periods

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   - Clear definition of extraction purposes
   - Restricted scope of processing
   - No secondary use without authorization

3. **Local Processing Guarantee**
   - No external API calls
   - No cloud model endpoints
   - No telemetry or usage analytics

4. **Transparency**
   - Open source codebase
   - Auditable processing logic
   - Clear data handling documentation

### Data Classification

| Data Type | Classification | Handling Requirements |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Patient Reports | PHI/Sensitive | Encrypted, access-controlled |
| Extraction Results | PHI/Sensitive | Encrypted, audited access |
| Configuration Files | Internal | Version controlled |
| System Logs | Internal | Retained per policy |
| Model Files | Public | Integrity verified |

## Security Implementation

### System Architecture Security

#### Container Isolation
```yaml
Security Configuration:
  - User namespace remapping
  - Read-only root filesystem
  - Dropped Linux capabilities
  - No privileged containers
  - Network isolation between services
```

#### Network Security
- **Internal Communication**: HTTP within Docker network
- **External Access**: HTTPS recommended via reverse proxy
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive ingress, monitored egress
- **Port Security**: Non-standard ports configurable

### Application Security

#### Authentication Options
1. **Basic Authentication** (Development)
   - Username/password
   - Not recommended for production

2. **LDAP/Active Directory** (Recommended)
   - Integration with institutional directory
   - Single sign-on support
   - Group-based access control

3. **SAML/OAuth2** (Enterprise)
   - Federated authentication
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Session management

#### Authorization Framework
```
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- Administrator: Full system access
- Researcher: Create/manage extractions
- Viewer: Read-only access to results
- Auditor: Access to logs only
```

### Data Encryption

#### Encryption at Rest
```bash
# Linux dm-crypt example
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1
cryptsetup open /dev/sdb1 medextract-data
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/medextract-data
mount /dev/mapper/medextract-data /mnt/medextract
```

#### Encryption in Transit
```nginx
# NGINX SSL Configuration
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/medextract.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/medextract.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
}
```

## HIPAA Compliance

### Technical Safeguards (45 CFR 164.312)

#### Access Control (164.312(a))
- Unique user identification
- Automatic logoff (configurable timeout)
- Encryption and decryption capabilities

#### Audit Controls (164.312(b))
```json
{
  "event": "data_extraction",
  "user": "researcher01",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "patient_count": 150,
  "data_elements": ["diagnosis", "medications"],
  "source_file": "radiology_reports_batch_01.csv",
  "result_file": "extracted_data_01.csv"
}
```

#### Integrity Controls (164.312(c))
- Input validation
- Output verification
- Checksum verification for files
- Version control for configurations

#### Transmission Security (164.312(e))
- Local processing only
- Encrypted file transfers when required
- Secure disposal of temporary files

### Administrative Safeguards (45 CFR 164.308)

#### Security Officer Responsibilities
1. Define access control policies
2. Monitor security events
3. Conduct risk assessments
4. Manage incident response

#### Workforce Training Requirements
- Security awareness training
- Proper data handling procedures
- Incident reporting protocols
- Annual compliance certification

#### Physical Safeguards (45 CFR 164.310)
- Server physical access controls
- Workstation security policies
- Device and media controls
- Secure disposal procedures

## Access Control

### User Management

#### Account Lifecycle
```mermaid
Account Creation → Initial Access → Periodic Review → Access Modification → Account Deactivation
        ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓                      ↓
   Approval Required  Training    Certification      Documentation         Audit Trail
```

#### Access Control Matrix

| Role | View Reports | Create Extractions | Modify Configs | View Logs | Admin Functions |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Administrator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Researcher | ✓ | ✓ | - | Own only | - |
| Viewer | ✓ | - | - | - | - |
| Auditor | - | - | - | ✓ | - |

### Privilege Management

#### Least Privilege Principle
- Default deny for all operations
- Explicit grants required
- Regular access reviews
- Automated de-provisioning

#### Segregation of Duties
- Configuration changes require approval
- Audit logs immutable to users
- Security functions separated from operations

## Audit and Monitoring
