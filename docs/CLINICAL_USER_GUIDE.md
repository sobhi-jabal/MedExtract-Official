   - Model: mistral:7b
   - Use Cases: Report type classification, simple findings
   - Processing Speed: 300-500 reports/hour

2. **Moderate Complexity** (measurements, multiple findings)
   - Model: llama2:13b
   - Use Cases: Tumor characteristics, medication lists
   - Processing Speed: 150-300 reports/hour

3. **Complex Extractions** (relationships, temporal data)
   - Model: phi4:latest
   - Use Cases: Disease progression, treatment response
   - Processing Speed: 100-200 reports/hour

### Configuration Parameters

#### Extraction Settings
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low variability for consistency)
- **Context Window**: 2000 tokens (sufficient for most reports)
- **Batch Size**: 10-50 reports (based on system resources)

#### Advanced Options
- **Enable RAG**: For complex, context-dependent extractions
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide 3-5 examples for complex patterns
- **Validation Rules**: Define acceptable value ranges

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Strategies

1. **Pilot Testing**
   - Process 50-100 reports initially
   - Manual review by clinical expert
   - Calculate accuracy metrics
   - Refine extraction instructions

2. **Ongoing Quality Monitoring**
   - Random sampling (5-10% of results)
   - Focus on high-stakes data elements
   - Track accuracy trends over time
   - Document discrepancies

3. **Clinical Review Process**
   ```
   Extraction → Automated Validation → Clinical Review → Final Dataset
                     ↓                        ↓
                Failed Rules            Manual Correction
   ```

### Accuracy Metrics

#### Key Performance Indicators
- **Sensitivity**: Ability to identify positive cases
- **Specificity**: Ability to identify negative cases
- **Positive Predictive Value**: Accuracy of positive extractions
- **Negative Predictive Value**: Accuracy of negative extractions

#### Acceptable Thresholds
- Research Use: >90% accuracy recommended
- Registry Population: >95% accuracy recommended
- Quality Metrics: >85% accuracy may be sufficient

### Error Analysis

Common extraction errors and mitigation strategies:

1. **Negation Errors**
   - Issue: "No evidence of malignancy" extracted as "malignancy"
   - Solution: Include negation terms in instructions

2. **Temporal Confusion**
   - Issue: Historical findings extracted as current
   - Solution: Specify temporal context in extraction rules

3. **Measurement Units**
   - Issue: Inconsistent unit extraction (cm vs mm)
   - Solution: Standardize unit expectations in instructions

## Result Interpretation

### Understanding Output Files

#### Standard Output Structure
```csv
Report_ID,Original_Text,diagnosis_extracted,confidence_score,extraction_timestamp
001,"{full report text}","Adenocarcinoma",0.92,2024-01-15T10:30:00
002,"{full report text}","No malignancy",0.88,2024-01-15T10:30:05
```

#### Metadata Fields
- **confidence_score**: Model's confidence (0-1 scale)
- **extraction_timestamp**: Processing time
- **model_version**: Which model performed extraction
- **validation_status**: Pass/fail/review needed

### Clinical Interpretation Guidelines

1. **High Confidence Extractions (>0.9)**
   - Generally reliable for well-defined data elements
   - Still requires sampling validation
   - Suitable for aggregate analysis

2. **Moderate Confidence (0.7-0.9)**
   - Requires closer review
   - May indicate ambiguous report language
   - Consider manual verification

3. **Low Confidence (<0.7)**
   - Mandatory manual review
   - May indicate complex cases
   - Possible model limitations
